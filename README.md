# Weather-trends-analysis
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

## Project walk through

The main aim of the project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. 
To do this, I followed the steps below:

- Extracted the data from the database. I exported the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live. I can find a list of cities and countries in the city_list table. I interacted with the database, I wrote a SQL query.
Wrote a SQL query to extract the city level data. Exported to CSV.
Wrote a SQL query to extract the global data. Exported to CSV.

- Opened up the CSV in whatever tool I felt most comfortable using. I suggest using Excel or Google sheets, but you are welcome to use another tool, such as Python or R.

- Created a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Made sure I plotted the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

- Made observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions I answered.
Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
“How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
